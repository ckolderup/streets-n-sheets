you'll need Twitter auth keys for any of this to work. Put them in .env and foreman will pick them up.

This project uses rbenv, bundler, and foreman. Install rbenv, get bundler set up, and then `rbenv exec bundle install`.

To test the output and see an example tweet on the command line, run `rbenv exec bundle exec foreman run ruby app.rb`
To actually tweet to the account oauthed via your .env vars, run `rbenv exec bundle exec foreman run ruby app.rb --tweet`
